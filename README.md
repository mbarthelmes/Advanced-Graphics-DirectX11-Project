This project was made with the assistance of this website tutorial: https://www.rastertek.com/tutdx11win10.html

This project was made in my Advanced Graphics class as a way to learn how to use DirectX11 in C++ on my own. Throughout the entire
learning process, I was able to put together this small project that displays a train going down a track.

**NOTE: I was unable to get the project to work unless I put the exact file paths.
        To run, change all file paths in applicationClass.cpp and lightShaderClass.cpp to your own file paths.

Controls:

W - Move forward (parallel to the ground)

S - Move back (parallel to the ground)

A - Move left

D - Move right

Up Arrow - Turn the camera up

Down Arrow - Turn the camera down

Left Arrow - Turn the camera left

Right Arrow - Turn the camera right

O - Change the direction of the train

P - Start/Stop the train

Esc - Quit the application
